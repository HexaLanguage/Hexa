# Hexa

`Ensures safety, simplicity and performance`

Hexa is a high level, strictly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript and native apps

## Key features of Hexa

- JavaScript-inspired syntax and behavior, feel yourself like at home!
- Native performance with static types and optimizing compiler
- Follows node.js (and browser) API
- Fast compilation
- Compiles to JavaScript, WebAssembly, [osdev](https://github.com/GreenteaOSForkByRDPStudio/Tofita), LLVM, C, C++, ObjC, ... you name it! **(WIP)**
- Transpilation to almost anything: Lua, AutoCAD Lisp, C#, PHP, etc **(WIP)**
- Transpilation produce human-readable code for all targets
- Null safety, crash resistance, pattern matching, classes **(WIP)**
- Real multithreading, parallelism, async\await, no GC **(WIP)**
- Smart type inference makes other typed languages look boring
- Friendly and helpful error messages
- Supports `#!shebang` and scripting (just call `hexa script.hexa`)
- REPL (enable with just `hexa` command)
- Metaprogramming with syntax-tree, generics and contracts **(WIP)**
- Completely cross-platform

> **WIP â€” Work in progress, coming soon**

Release of 2.0.0 (All WIP completed) expected in Fall 2022


## Build

You need to download latest long-term [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/).
The Hexa Compiler is written in Hexa itself. Pre-built compiler (bootstrapper) already included in the repo.

```sh
cd hexa
node bootstrap.js hexa.json
# This results in a `hexa-node.js` file in the root of the repo
# Call `node hexa-node.js project.json` to build your projects
```

Optionally to build .exe and add icon:

```sh
npm i -g nexe
nexe-build.bat
```
